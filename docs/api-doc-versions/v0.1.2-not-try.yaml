  title: TFG Trending Series v0 `Offline`
  description: >-
    The API is accessible via https://darkhollow.github.com/tfg-series-playAPI/
    and provides the following `REST` endpoints in `JSON` format.



    How to use this API documentation

    ----------------



    You may browse the API routes freely without any authentication.


    You will **NOT** be able to use the routes to send requests to the API and
    get a response because this is a `Offline Documentation` for `Github Pages`.

    Because of that, the button `Try it out` is disabled in all the routes.



    Versioning

    ----------------



    This documentation automatically uses the version seen at the top and
    bottom of the page.
